On August 20th, 2024, I got an email from the Swedish Game Awards (SGA) team saying that Sonder had been nominated in the categories Best Technology & Best Audio! I shared the news with the team who got very excited, and we started planning for the showcase event on September 5th where players could come and try out and vote for their favorite games.

## The awards ceremony

The gala took place at Nalen in Stockholm the day after the showcase, and started with the awards ceremony together with a three-course dinner. The first prize of the evening was the Gamers' Choice award, decided by the players who had visited the showcase the day before. And:
