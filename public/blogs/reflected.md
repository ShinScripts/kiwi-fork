# Intro
some text about why & what it is

# Requirements
To mimic a user's own setup in a game, we need to know a few things:
* How many monitors does the user have?
 * What are the resolutions of these monitors?
 * How are they positioned in relation to each other?
 * What size are they?
 * How are they rotated?
 * Are they curved?
 * ... and so on.
